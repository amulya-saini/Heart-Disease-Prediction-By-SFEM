# Heart Disease Prediction using Feature Selection and Soft Voting Ensemble Model Building

Early prediction of heart disease is crucial for preventing fatalities, given its status as the leading cause of death. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze a comprehensive dataset, aiming to identify patterns indicative of heart disease risk. Through feature selection and a Soft Voting Ensemble model, the project harnesses the power of various machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Data Source and Tasks

- The dataset comprises 11 features and a target variable, sourced from medical records.
- Tasks include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, and preprocessing.

## Model Evaluation

- Model evaluation is conducted using metrics such as cross-validation scores, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC curves.
- Additional evaluation metrics include precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, classification error, log loss, and Matthews correlation coefficient.

## Model Implementation

- Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
- Ensemble methods such as AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost are employed alongside other classifiers like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.
